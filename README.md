# CSCI4022_FinalProject
Our main code for this project is located in the k_means_assets.ipynb and em.ipynb files. These include our core logic for the algorithms we used for our analysis. Additionally, you can find our scraped data in the cleanAssets folder and our data preprocessing in dataCleaner.ipynb and WSJ_scrapper.ipynb
